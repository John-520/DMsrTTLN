This is the source code for "Deep Multilayer Sparse Regularization Time-Varying Transfer Learning Networks With Dynamic Kullbackâ€“Leibler Divergence Weights for Mechanical Fault Diagnosis". You can refer to the following steps to reproduce the cross device fault diagnosis experiment under time-varying speed.

## Dataset Preparation

**You can find the dataset download link in references [24-26], and the paper can be downloaded from my personal homepage [here](https://john-520.github.io/).**


### Cross-Machine Condition

For example:

```python
mian.py
---dataloaders  #dataset

```
